# BiomeGen
### Released July 2025
### Version 2.1.3
### Updated September 2025

# Note: this branch is in development. It is an attempt to rewrite the project in C.

## Description
BiomeGen is a C map generation tool that provides output in a png format.
Customization options include map dimensions, island abundance, island size, and
island abundance relative to water. Generates water, land, and various biomes.
Uses multiprocessing in C for increased efficiency. Includes automated
runs and another C program to create multiple images or test generation speed.

## Automation

This project includes the ability to run in an automated mode. There are two ways
to do this:

1. Add arguments when running the main C file. With a command like
   `./main 1920 1080 100 120 50 5 8 file_path.png`, you can pass arguments
   that will be used by the C program, skipping over manual inputs. The arguments
   passed are: map width, map height, map resolution, island abundance, island size,
   coastline smoothing, cpu processes, and output path. Except for the output path,
   all of these inputs must be integers. These arguments are not sanitized, meaning
   they can be outside of the limits imposed for manual inputs, which can break
   the program (e.g. a negative map width). This option will only print the
   generation time for the C program.

2. Use the `autorun.c` program and `autorun_tasks.txt`. The C program runs
   the main C program and handles passing arguments. It gets its instructions
   from `autorun_tasks.txt`. Each line represents one task, empty lines and comments
   will cause errors. Currently, it contains the example task
   `2:n:n:1920 1080 100 120 50 5 8 file_path.png`. The C program will also add
   statistics, including mean generation time, percentiles, and more. Statistics
   will be saved to the file `autorun_results.csv`. The statistics currently there
   are for comparing versions at this project's website, and can be removed on any
   clones or forks, but be careful to leave the first line alone.

     - `2` is the number of repetitions, meaning the main C program will be run
       twice. This must be a positive integer.
     - `n` is whether to show the times for each repetition (y/n). Yes means each
       repetition will show the time it took to run upon completion. This can be
       useful for measuring variation between repetitions, but can take up a lot
       of space in your terminal for tasks with many repetitions. No will just
       show a progress bar based on the number of tasks completed.
       Must be "y" or "n".
     - `n` is whether to save the png outputs (y/n). Yes means each output will
       be saved in a separate file, repetition 1 in `file_path1.png`, repetition
       2 in `file_path2.png`, etc. No means each repetition will overwrite the
       previous, and `file_path.png` will be deleted at the end of the program.
       Must be "y" or "n".
     - `1920 1080 100 120 50 5 8 file_path.png` is simply the arguments to be passed
       to the main C program. The only one that may be edited by the C program
       is `file_path.png`, which will be edited if "y" in the second C program
       argument. Must follow the rules for C arguments in 1. Max 99 characters.
    
    With this option, you can generated multiple different png files from the same
    inputs, or test the generation speed of the main C program. This option will
    also tell you the generation times for each repetition, and the average
    generation time.

## Other Files
 - `sample_inputs.txt`
   Includes a number of inputs that can pasted into your terminal
   (Ctrl + Shift + V usually works for this).
